# 100 Days of Code - Python 🐍

I’ve recently decided to brush up on my programming skills and started a 100 Days of Code challenge. Angela Yu's [Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.

Why Python? I find it fun and practical — especially for robotics projects in my business.

I actually started this course few years ago but never finished it. Back then, I was just launching my business and didn’t have the time to practice or apply what I learned.

This time, I’m giving it a proper go. Let’s see how far I can get! 🚀
